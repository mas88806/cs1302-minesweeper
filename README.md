# CSCI 1302 - Minesweeper Alpha Project

**DUE Sunday 2016-01-31 (Jan 31st) @ 11:59 PM**

This repository contains the skeleton code for the Minesweeper Alpha project
assigned to the students in the Spring 2016 CSCI 1302 classes
at the University of Georgia. 

**Please read the entirety of this file before
beginning your project.** 

## Academic Honesty

You agree to the Academic Honesty policy as outlined in the course syllabus and
course website. In accordance with this notice, I must caution you to **not** 
fork this repository on GitHub if you have an account. Doing so will more than
likely make your copy of the project publicly visible. Please follow the 
instructions contained in the Resources section below in order to do your 
development on nike.

## Updates

Updates will be posted here.

If there has been an update and you have already cloned the project to Nike, 
then you can update your copy of the project using the <code>$ git pull</code>
command while inside of your project directory.

## Project Description

This first project is meant to ensure that you are able to apply and extend
your prequisite knowledge as well as introduce you to developing and testing
a Java 7 application in a Linux environment (i.e., the Nike development
server). Many aspects of this project will be new to you. You will be asked
to do things that you have never been given explicit directions for before.
This is just a part of software development. Sometimes you need to research
how to solve a problem in order to implement a solution. That being said,
the material included in this document should hopefully answer the majority
of your questions.

Your goal is to develop a non-recursive, non-GUI (GUI = Graphical User 
Interface) version of the game called Minesweeper. The code for this game will
be organized in such a way that the recursive elements of Minesweeper can
be added at a later point in time. It will also be organized so that you can
add a GUI to it later as well. Interestingly, the organization of some of the 
classes in this project will also introduce you to some elementary aspects of
game programming.

This project must be implemented in Java 7 or 8, and it must compile and run 
correctly on Nike using instructions that you will provide in an
<code>INSTRUCTIONS.md</code> file (more on that later).

### Minesweeper Overview

In Minesweeper, the player is initially presented with a grid of 
undifferentiated squares. Either some randomly-selected squares or seed-selected
squares (more on seeds later) are designated to contain mines. Typically, the
size of the grid and the number of mines are set in advance by the user or by a
seed file. The ratio of the number of mines to the grid size is often used as a
measure of an individual game's difficulty. The grid size can also be
represented in terms of the number of rows and columns in the grid.

The game is played in rounds. During each round, the player is presented with
the grid, the number of rounds completed so far, as well as a prompt. The player
has the option to do 5 different things:

 1. Reveal a square on the grid.
 2. Mark a square as potentially containing a mine.
 3. Mark a square as definitely containing a mine.
 4. Display help information.
 5. Quit the game.

When the player reveals a square of the grid, different things can happen. If 
the revealed square contains a mine, then the player loses the game. If the 
revealed square does not contain a mine, then a digit is instead displayed in 
the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines (in the 
recursive implementation, if no mines are adjacent, then the square becomes 
blank). Typically, there are 8 squares adjacent to any given square, unless
the square lies on an edge or corner of the grid.

The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares, and 
may perform any of the first three options in the list presented above. When the
player marks a square as potentially containing a mine, a <code>?</code> is 
displayed in the square. When the player marks the square as definitely 
containing a mine, a flag, represented as <code>F</code> is displayed in the 
square. The player can mark or reveal any square in the grid, even squares that
have already been marked or reveleaed. The logic for determining what happens
to the square is always the same.

The game is won when both all of the mines are located (i.e., all squares 
containing a mine are marked by the user as containing a mine) and when there 
are no squares still marked as potentially containing a mine. At the end of the
game the player is presented with a score. 
Let <code>rows</code>, <code>cols</code>, <code>mines</code>, and 
<code>rounds</code> denote the number of rows in the grid, columns in the grid,
total number of mines, and number of rounds completed, respectively. The 
player's score is calculated as follows:

```java
score = (rows * cols) - mines - rounds;
```

The higher the score, the better. Negative scores are possible.

### The Grid and Interface

When the game begins, the following message should be displayed to the player
once and only once:

```
        _
  /\/\ (_)_ __   ___  _____      _____  ___ _ __   ___ _ __
 /    \| | '_ \ / _ \/ __\ \ /\ / / _ \/ _ \ '_ \ / _ \ '__|
/ /\/\ \ | | | |  __/\__ \\ V  V /  __/  __/ |_) |  __/ |
\/    \/_|_| |_|\___||___/ \_/\_/ \___|\___| .__/ \___|_|
                                     ALPHA |_| EDITION
```

Take care when printing this message out to the screen. You will probably need
to escape some of the characters in order for them to show up correctly.

In this Minesweeper game, the size of the grid is restricted to no more than 10
rows and 10 columns. The number of rows and columns need not be the same. To be
more precise, the number of rows must be strictly greater than 0 and less than
or equal to 10. The number of columns must also be strictly greater than 0 and
less than or equal to 10. Rows and columns are indexed starting at 0. Therefore,
in a 10*10 (rows * columns), the first row is indexed as 0 and the last row is
indexed as 9 (similarly for columns).

Let's assume we are, in fact, playing a 10*10 game of Minesweeper. When the game
starts, the interface should look like this:

```

 Rounds Completed: 0

 2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 4 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 5 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

 7 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 8 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 9 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9

minesweeper-alpha$ 
```

Please note that the first, third, and second-to-last lines are blank. All other 
lines, except the last line containing the prompt, start with one blank space. 
The line containing the prompt contains an extra space after the <code>$</code> 
so that when the user types in a command, the text does not touch the 
<code>$</code>.

The possible commands that can be entered into the prompt as well as their
syntax are listed in the subsections below. Commands with leading or trailing
white space are to be interpreted as if there were no leading or trailing
whitespace. For example, the following two examples should be interpreted the
same:

```
minesweeper-alpha$ help
minesweeper-alpha$         help
```

The different parts of a command are known as tokens. The <code>help</code>
command, for example, only has one token. Other commands, such as the
<code>mark</code> (seen below) have more than one token because other
pieces of information are needed in order to interpret the command. As a quick
example (which will be explored in more depth below), the player can
mark the square at coordinate (0,0) using <code>mark</code> as follows:

```
minesweeper-alpha$ mark 0 0
```

In the above example, you can see that the <code>mark</code> command has three 
tokens. A command with more than one token is still considered syntactically 
correct if there is more than one white space between tokens. For example, the 
following four examples should be interpreted the same:

```
minesweeper-alpha$ mark 0 0
minesweeper-alpha$ mark     0  0
minesweeper-alpha$     mark 0 0
minesweeper-alpha$   mark     0  0
```

#### Command Syntax Format

In the sections below, each command will the syntax format that it must adhere
to in order to be considered correct. Syntactically incorrect commands are
considered an error. Information about displaying errors to the player is
contained in a section below. 

In a syntax format string, one or more white space is represented as a
<code>-</code>. Command tokens are enclosed in <code>[]</code> braces. If the
contents of a token are surrounded by <code>""</code> marks, then that token can 
only take on that literal value. If more than one literal value is accepted for
a token, then the quoted literals are separated by <code>/</code>. If the
contents of a token are surrounded by <code>()</code> marks, then that token can
only take on a value of the type expressed in parentheses.  

Syntax format strings are provided in this document in order to help you, the
student, understand how syntactically correct commands could potentially be 
inputted by the player. These strings do not directly correspond to anything in
the Java programming language. You should be able to use the information
provided in these syntax format strings to parse commands entered by the
user. 

#### Revealing a Square

In order to reveal a square, the <code>reveal</code> or <code>r</code> command
is used. The syntax format for this command is as follows: <code>-["reveal"/"r"]-[(int)]-[(int)]-</code>.
The second and third tokens indicate the row and column indices, respectively, 
of the square to be revealed. 

Let's go back to our 10*10 example. Suppose that we secretly know that there is
a mine in squares (1,1) and (1,3). Now suppose that the player wants to reveal
square (1, 2). Here is an example of what that might look like.

```

 2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 4 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 5 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 6 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 7 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 8 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 9 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9

minesweeper-alpha$ 
```

After the player correctly entered the command <code>r 1 2</code>, the state of
the game updates (e.g., number of rounds completed, the grid, etc.), and the
next round happens. Since there was no mine in square (1,2), the player does not
lose the game. Also, since the number of mines adjacent to square (1,2) is 2, the
number 2 is now placed in that cell.

If the player reveals a square containing a mine, then the following message
should be displayed and the program should terminate gracefully:

```

 Oh no... You revealed a mine!
  __ _  __ _ _ __ ___   ___    _____   _____ _ __ 
 / _` |/ _` | '_ ` _ \ / _ \  / _ \ \ / / _ \ '__|
| (_| | (_| | | | | | |  __/ | (_) \ V /  __/ |   
 \__, |\__,_|_| |_| |_|\___|  \___/ \_/ \___|_|   
 |___/                                            

```

Yeah, that's old school ASCII art. Please note that the first and last lines are
blank. Also note that the second line begins with a single white space. All other
lines should be copied verbatim from this document (e.g., you can just copy and
paste it using your plain text editor).

The program should exit gracefully. This means that exit code should be zero.
For example, the following snippet will accomplish this:

```java
System.exit(0);
```

If your program exits with any return codes other than zero (e.g., if your game
crashes), then some points will be deducted.

#### Mark Command

In order to mark a square as definitely containing a mine, the 
<code>mark</code> or <code>m</code> command is used. The syntax format for this 
command is as follows: <code>-["mark"/"m"]-[(int)]-[(int)]-</code>.
The second and third tokens indicate the row and column indices, respectively, 
of the square to be revealed. 

Let's go back to our 10*10 example. Suppose that the player wants to mark
square (1, 2). Here is an example of what that might look like.

```

After the player correctly entered the command <code>m 1 2</code>, the state of
the game updates (e.g., number of rounds completed, the grid, etc.), and the
next round happens. 

#### Guess Command

In order to mark a square as potentially containing a mine, the 
<code>guess</code> or <code>g</code> command is used. The syntax format for this 
command is as follows: <code>-["guess"/"g"]-[(int)]-[(int)]-</code>.
The second and third tokens indicate the row and column indices, respectively, 
of the square to be revealed. 

Let's go back to our 10*10 example. Suppose that the player wants to guess
square (1, 2). Here is an example of what that might look like.

After the player correctly entered the command <code>g 1 2</code>, the state of
the game updates (e.g., number of rounds completed, the grid, etc.), and the
next round happens.

#### Help Command

In order to show the help menu, the <code>help</code> or <code>h</code> command
is used. The syntax format for this command is as follows: <code>-["help"/"h"]-</code>.

Let's go back to our 10*10 example. Suppose that the player wants to display
the help menu. Here is an example of what that might look like.

Note that the first and last lines are blank and that the beginning of the
other lines contain a single white space. You should replace the score in the
output with the actual calculated score (mentioned above).

#### Displaying Errors

In the constructor, if the number of rows and columns is not in proper bounds, 
then the following message should be displayed and the program should exit
gracefully:

```

ಠ_ಠ says, "Cannot create a mine field with that many rows and/or columns!"
```

Note that the first line is blank.

If a command is not recognized, then the following message should be displayed 
to the player and one round should be consumed:

```

ಠ_ಠ says, "Command not recognized!"
```

Note that the first line is blank. 

Let's go back to our 10*10 example. Suppose that the player either leaves the
prompt blank or enters in some command that is not recognized.
Here is an example of what that might look like.

```

minesweeper-alpha$ 
```

After the player entered the unknown command <code>meh</code>, the state of
the game updates (e.g., number of rounds completed, the grid, etc.), the
error message is displayed, and the next round happens. 

### Seed Files

This game can also be setup using seed files. Seed files have the following
format:

 * The first line contains two integers (separated by white-space) indicating the 
   number of <code>rows</code> and <code>cols</code>, respectively, for the size 
   of the mine board. 

 * The second line contains an integer indicating the number of mines to be 
   placed on the mine board.

 * Subsequent lines contain pairs of integers (separated by white space) 
   indicating the location of each mine.

If the number on line 2 is 5 then there should be 7 lines total in the file.
That is, one line for the board size, one line for the number of mines, and 5
lines indicating mine positions. If there are more lines in the file than what
is expected, then those lines are to be ignored.

If a seed file is not formatted correctly, then then the program should exit
and the following message should be displayed:

```
Cannot create game with FILENAME, because it is not formatted correctly.

```

Note that the second line is empty. Also, be sure to replace FILENAME with 
the actual name of the file.

A seed file is also considered to be malformed if the grid size is not an
acceptable grid size, if the number of mines exceeds the number of squares in
the grid, and if a mine location is specified as being outside of the grid.

An example seed file is present in the project materials. In order to run
your program with the seed file, you should be able to use the following
command:

```
$ java Minesweeper seed1.txt
```

## Project Tasks

The tasks for this project are mostly related to implementing methods inside of
<code>Minesweeper.java</code>. There are some additional tasks, though, so
please read the following list of tasks carefully:

 * Implement or finish implementing the methods in <code>Minesweeper.java</code>
   as per the project description provided above. Be sure to include in-line 
   Java comments and white space where appropriate in order to make your code 
   both readable and clear.

 * Make sure that all methods are documented using JavaDoc comments, even
   methods that you create yourself.

 * Update the @author tag in the JavaDoc comment for the 
   <code>Minesweeper</code> class in <code>Minesweeper.java</code> to include 
   your name and UGA email address.

 * Update the <code>INSTRUCTIONS.md</code> file to include instructions on how
   to both compile and run your program, assuming one is in the same directory
   as <code>Minesweeper.java</code>. Instructions for running your program
   should be consistent with the documentation provided to you in the
   <code>main</code> method in <code>Minesweeper.java</code>.

## Project Grading

Your project will be graded based on a combination of test cases and source code
inspection. If your program does not compile on Nike, then it will **not** be 
graded. If your program crashes (throws an exception and or exits unexpectedly),
then no points are earned for that test case, even if there is partial output.

Assuming your program can be run consistent with the documentation provided to 
you in the <code>main</code> method in <code>Minesweeper.java</code>, you can use
the following command to execute the first test case:

```
$ java Minesweeper seed1.txt < test1.txt > test1.result.txt
```

This command tells the program to create a game using the <code>seed1.txt</code>
seed file, execute the commands contained in the <code>test1.txt</code> test case 
file, and output the results into the <code>test1.result.txt</code> file. Once
you have your result file, you can compare it to <code>test1.expected.txt</code>.

## Extra Credit Tasks

You may earn up to 5 extra credit points for implementing the following command
in addition to the five that are already required:

#### No Fog Command

You might find this extra credit command to be useful for debugging. 
Essentially, this command removes, for the next round only, what is often
referred to as the "fog of war." Squares containing mines, whether unrevealed, 
marked, or guessed, will be displayed with less-than and greater-than symbols on
either side of the square's center (as apposed to white space). Using the
<code>nofog</code> command **does** use up a round.

Let's go back to our 10*10 example. Suppose that we secretly know that there is
a mine in squares (1,1) and (1,3). If the player marked square (1,1) during the
first round and then used the <code>nofog</code> command during the second
round, then here is an example of what that scenario might look like:
```

 8 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9

minesweeper-alpha$ 
```

Note: This command should **not** be listed when the <code>help</code> command
is used. Also, it should be implemented in a similar fashion to the way the
other commands are implemented. You will need to add extra methods and
instance variables to accomplish this.

## Suggestions

This project will be a lot easier if you structure your code properly. There is
not a single correct way to do this, but here are some ideas for support methods 
that I think will make things easier. These are just suggestions. If you choose
to use these, then you will need to implement them yourself.

```java
/**
 * Returns the number of mines adjacent to the specified
 * square in the grid. 
 *
 * @param row the row index of the square
 * @param col the column index of the square
 * @return the number of adjacent mines
 */
private int getNumAdjMines(int row, int col) { }
```

The method above (as well as some other methods) can be implemented a lot more
easily if you have an easy way to determine if a square is in bounds. Here is
a suggestion for a method that does just that.

```java
/**
 * Indicates whether or not the square is in the game grid.
 *
 * @param row the row index of the square
 * @param col the column index of the square
 * @return true if the square is in the game grid; false otherwise
 */
private boolean isInBounds(int row, int col) { }
```

Also, it might be easier to use two different arrays (of the same size) in order
to keep track of the game grid. One of the arrays could be a two-dimensional
boolean array that indicates mine locations. The other array could be a 
two-dimensional char or String array that holds the blanks, numbers, and other
characters for each square. 


## How to Download the Project

On Nike, execute the following terminal command in order to download the project
files into sub-directory within your present working directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mepcotterell-cs1302/cs1302-minesweeper-alpha.git
```

This should create a directory called <code>cs1302-minesweeper-alpha</code> in
your present working directory that contains the project files.

If any updates to the project files are announced by your instructor, you can
merge those changes into your copy by changing into your project's directory
on Nike and issuing the following terminal command:

```
$ git pull
```

If you have any problems with any of these procedures, then please contact
your instructor.

## Submission Instructions

You will still be submitting your project via Nike. Make sure your project files
are on <code>nike.cs.uga.edu</code>. Change into the parent directory of your
project directory and let <code>PROJ_DIR</code> represent the name of your 
project directory in the instructions provided below. If you've followed the
instructions provided in this document, then the name of your project directory
is likely <code>cs1302-minesweeper-alpha</code>. While in your project parent
directory, execute the following command, depending on which section you are in:

### CRN 26245

    $ submit cs1302-minesweeper-alpha cs1302a

### CRN 26311

    $ submit cs1302-minesweeper-alpha cs1302b

### CRN 36424

    $ submit cs1302-minesweeper-alpha cs1302c

It is also a good idea to email a copy to yourself. To do this, simply execute 
the following command, replacing the email address with your email address:

```
$ tar zcvf cs1302-minesweeper-alpha.tar.gz cs1302-minesweeper-alpha
$ mutt -s "[cs1302] cs1302-minesweeper-alpha" -a cs1302-minesweeper-alpha.tar.gz -- your@email.com < /dev/null
```

If you have any problems submitting your project then please email your
instructor as soon as possible. However, emailing him about something like this
the day or night the project is due is probably not the best idea.
